<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course objectives</h3>
<p>This is a course in advanced data analysis. Based on the theory of linear models covered in S431, this course will focus on applying many types of data analysis methods to interesting datasets. The focus will be dealing with and describing data rather than on particular methods per se.</p>
<p>The course combines analysis with methodology and computational aspects. It treats both the “art” of understanding unfamiliar data and the “science” of analyzing that data in terms of statistical properties. The focus will be on practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own lives.</p>
<p>I expect that the material should be appropriate and interesting to students coming from either statistics or informatics/computer science. I will make an effort to provide necessary background so that lectures are accessible to both populations.</p>
<p>We will put special emphasis on learning to use certain tools common to companies which actually <em>do</em> data science. This includes <a href="https://stats-432sp2020.slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stats-432sp2020">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">Rstudio</a>, and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>. As such, we will require the use of these technologies.</p>
</div>
<div id="lecture-content" class="section level3">
<h3>Lecture content</h3>
<p>Class time will consist of a combination of lecture, discussion, questions and answers, and problem solving, with a focus on problem solving. You are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop to class.</p>
</div>
<div id="textbook" class="section level3">
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>The required textbook for this class is still in progress, but is excellent. Download it somewhat regularly, as it is still being updated.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-communication" class="section level3">
<h3>Course communication</h3>
<div id="philosophy" class="section level4">
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>This class will use <a href="https://stats-432sp2020.slack.com/">Slack</a> for class communication. Slack is a Team messaging app which is frequently adopted by companies and research groups. We will use it for announcements, questions, homework communication, etc. You are required to use it.</p>
<p>Since homework and the project are team-based, you need a way to communicate with your team. Slack is that way. You can create a special channel for your team. You can direct message individuals. You can message me or the TA. You can post pictures of cats. The sky is the limit. By using Slack, we will avoid sending lots of email back and forth.</p>
<p>Slack has apps for iPhone or Android, Mac or Windows. Or you can use the web.</p>
<p>If you send me email instead, I may ignore it.</p>
</div>
<div id="rules" class="section level4">
<h4>Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>All content-related (non-personal) questions should be asked in <a href="https://stats-432sp2020.slack.com/">Slack</a>. Use the <code>general</code> channel for homework, lecture, or other questions. For personal issues, direct message me (<span class="citation">@dajmcdon</span>) or the TA.<br />
</li>
<li>Before posting a new question please make sure to check if your question has already been answered. Just search.<br />
</li>
<li>It may be more efficient to answer your question “in-person” so make good use of office hours (2.5 hours per week).<br />
</li>
<li>Emails will almost certainly be ignored.<br />
</li>
<li>I generally reply to messages during normal business hours (M-F). My typical response time is 24 hours. Please don’t message me on Slack, wait an hour without response, email me, email me again, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>10 In-class exercises (5 points each)<br />
10 Reading responses (5 points each)<br />
6 Homeworks (25 points each)<br />
1 Course project (PC 1/PC 2/PC 3/Presentation 15/35/75/25)<br />
2 Take-home exams (150 points each)</p>
<p>In all cases, a fixed number of points may be <strong>earned</strong> for each exercise. Points are not deducted for poor performance in this class. Points are awarded for excellent performance.</p>
<div id="in-class-exercises" class="section level4">
<h4>In-class exercises</h4>
<p>We will regularly have short programming or theoretical exercises during class time. At the end of class, you will push your results to Github for grading. Complete submissions will receive full credit. Partial submissions will receive 2 points. There will be at least 10 of these during the semester. Any submissions you make in excess of 10 will be extra credit.</p>
</div>
<div id="reading-responses" class="section level4">
<h4>Reading responses</h4>
<p>Each chapter will have a short coding exercise which you should submit before we cover the chapter. I will post the exercise on Github, you clone it and upload your changes. These will generally be due before class begins on <strong>Tuesday</strong> each week. Complete submissions will receive full credit. Partial submissions will receive 2 points. There will be at least 10 of these during the semester. Any submissions you make in excess of 10 will be extra credit.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworks" class="section level4">
<h4>Homeworks</h4>
<p>Homework assignments will be completed in groups which I assign. These groups will rotate for each assignment. Each team will have their own private repository. All assignments will be submitted on Github. Homework grades will be awarded based on complete and accurate analyses according to the rubric provided with each assignment. Grades will be adjusted up or down based on participation according to the Github commit messages. You are expected to consult only with me, the TA, or your assigned group, with the exception of conversations which occur during class meetings or office hours in the presence of me or the TA. This means that you and your friend (who is in a different group) may not do the homework together.</p>
</div>
<div id="project" class="section level4">
<h4>Project</h4>
<p>You will be required to complete a team project (2-4 people). You may choose this group. The goal is to analyze a dataset in depth using anything that you have learned. The project will have three checkpoints: PC 1 will be due <strong>Thursday, January 30</strong>, PC 2 is due <strong>Thursday, March 12</strong>, PC 3 is due on <strong>Tuesday, May 5</strong>. All are to be uploaded to your repo by 11:59pm on those dates. See the <a href="project.html">project</a> page for detailed requirements.</p>
<p>The entire class will give brief presentations during the last week of classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level4">
<h4>Exams</h4>
<p>There will be two take home exams. Both will be completed entirely individually. The midterm will be made available on <strong>Wednesday, Febuary 26</strong> for submission by <strong>Wednesday, March 4</strong>. The second exam will be available <strong>Friday, April 17</strong> for submission by <strong>Friday, April 24</strong>. In both cases, the exam file will be downloaded from your personal repo at 11:59pm on the due date. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>If either of these dates pose some type of problem, you must notify me no later than Friday, January 17. After this date, no alternatives will be considered without medical documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="important-considerations" class="section level3">
<h3>Important considerations</h3>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level4">
<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the <a href="http://www.iu.edu/~code/">Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct</a>. When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. All suspected violations of the Code will be handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities, and must include a report to the Dean of Students, who may impose additional disciplinary sanctions.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-selling" class="section level4">
<h4>Note Selling</h4>
<p>Several commercial services have approached students regarding selling class notes/study guides to their classmates. Please be advised that selling a faculty member’s notes/study guides individually or on behalf of one of these services using IU email, Canvas, or Oncourse violates both IU information technology and IU intellectual property policy. Selling the faculty member’s notes/study guides to fellow students in this course is not permitted. Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct and will be reported to the Dean of Students as a violation of course rules (academic misconduct). Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment for which the notes/study guides are being sold, a reduction in your final course grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="solutions" class="section level4">
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Some of the problems that are assigned are similar or identical to those assigned in previous years by me or other instructors for this or other courses. Using proofs or code from anywhere other than the textbooks (with attribution), this year’s course notes (with attribution), or the course website is not only considered cheating (as described above), it is easily detectable cheating. Such behavior is strictly forbidden.</p>
</div>
<div id="cheating" class="section level4">
<h4>Cheating</h4>
<p>In previous years, I have caught students cheating on the exams. I did not enforce any penalty because the action did not help. Cheating, in my experience, occurs because students don’t understand the material, so the result is usually a failing grade even before I impose any penalty and report the incident to the Dean’s office. I carefully structure exams to make it so that I can catch these issues. I <strong>will</strong> catch you, and it does not help. Do your own work, and use the TA and me as resources. If you are struggling, we are here to help.</p>
<p><em>If I suspect cheating, your case will be forwarded to the Dean’s office. No questions asked.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="title-ix" class="section level4">
<h4>Title IX</h4>
<p>As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. Title IX and our own Sexual Misconduct policy prohibit sexual misconduct. If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help. If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with The Sexual Assault Crisis Service (SACS) at 812-855-8900; Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 812-855-5711; Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at 812-856-2469; or the IU Health Center at 812-855-4011. More information about available resources can be found at <a href="http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu/help/index.html">here</a>. It is also important that you know that federal regulations and University policy require me to promptly convey any information about potential sexual misconduct known to me to our campus’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator. In that event, they will work with a small number of others on campus to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available to the student who may have been harmed. Protecting a student’s privacy is of utmost concern, and all involved will only share information with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. I encourage you to visit <a href="http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu" class="uri">http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu</a> to learn more.</p>
