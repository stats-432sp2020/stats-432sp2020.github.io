## Overview

The premise of this project is  simple. You are to pick a real data set for which you believe there are interesting questions to answer. Alternatively, you will try to create/find a dataset that you can use to answer some question your group cares about. You will then use appropriate statistical learning approaches, covered in this course or others, to answer the questions to the extent possible.

You will submit three written components and your group will deliver a 15 minute presentation during the last week of class.

- Project checkpoint 0: due __Thursday, January 30__
- Project checkpoint 1: due __Thursday, January 30__
- Project checkpoint 2: due __Thursday, March 12__
- Project checkpoint 3: due __Tuesday, May 5__
- Project presentations: Tuesday/Thursday, April 28/30

## Checkpoint 0

Before the due date of checkpoint 1, you must let me know (via Slack) who is in your group. This way I can create a repo for you to collaborate and submit your work.

## Project checkpoint 1

This is a 1-page long synopsis of your intentions. It should contain the following information: 

1. project title 
2. team members
3. description of the data (include the number of observations, number of predictors, what the different predictors are, etc.)
4. precise description of the question(s) you are trying to answer 
5. a few sentences describing why this question/dataset is interesting to you
6. reading list (papers you may need to read)

## Project checkpoint 2

This should build on the previous submission.

Your report must consist of the following sections.

0. Project title and list of teammates
1. A few sentences describing why this project is interesting to you (approx 1 paragraph).
2. __Introduction:__ A description of how the data came about and what things you may be investigating. What is the data? What are you trying to do? How did you get the data? Why should anyone care about any of this? Etc., etc. (approx 0.5--1 page)  
This section will appear in your final report as well, possibly
expanded to foreshadow the results you have by that point
discovered, so spend some time to make it good, and your effort will
not be wasted.
3. __Exploratory data analysis:__ Begin to examine your data. Make many graphics. 
    * This is exploratory. Even basic
    conclusions are useful. 
    * Go overboard. Make far more plots than you will keep
    * I strongly urge you to divide and conquer. Have different
    group members investigate different things. Recombine to discuss
    your results and iterate.
    * Do not leave this until the last minute. I guarantee you
    will receive poor scores. This will take sustained, consistent
    effort. Start NOW.

    This section should occupy the remainder of your report.

Total page length: about 10 pages. It will render in html,
and graphics may be large, but this is the idea were it to be
printed. Be sure to describe your graphics
carefully both in the text and with nice labels. Plots with no description are not useful. 
Anything exceptionally interesting will be
rewarded. Ugly plots, uninterpretable analysis, etc. will be
penalized.

### PC 2 Rubric

```{r grade-vector-pc2, echo=FALSE}
a = c(7, 1, 8, 4, 15, 0)
tot = sum(a)
ab_print <- function(pos, modify){
  a <- a
  b <- a[pos]
  c <- b + modify
  a[pos] <- c
  a <<- a
  paste0(c,' / ', b)
}
```

__Words__ (`r ab_print(1, 0)`) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions
and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself
is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors,
divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and
sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge. 

__Numbers__ (`r ab_print(2, 0)`) All numerical results or summaries are reported to
suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty
attached when applicable. 

__Pictures__ (`r ab_print(3, 0)`) Figures and tables are easy to read, with
informative captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the
relevant pieces of text or referred to with convenient labels. 

__Code__ (`r ab_print(4, 0)`) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy
for others to read and understand. It is indented, commented, and uses
meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually
needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code
borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is
explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or
procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests
which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of
the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. With regards to R Markdown,
all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only
relevant results are shown.

__Exploratory data analysis__ (`r ab_print(5, 0)`) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.


__Extra credit__ (`r ab_print(6, 0)`) Up to ten points may be awarded for reports
which are unusually well-written, where the code is unusually elegant,
where the analytical methods are unusually insightful, or where the
analysis goes beyond the required set of analytical questions. 


__Grade__: `r sum(a)` out of  `r tot` possible


## Project checkpoint 3

Each group should submit one report. It must consist of the following
sections. (page numbers are relative as your report should render in html)

1. __Introduction__ (1 page) Write three to four paragraphs introducing the research
  problem and describing the specific research hypothesis. Cite any information
  sources in parentheses or foot- or end- notes.
2. __EDA__ (about 5 pages) This section should incorporate some
  material from the 
  Midterm report (with any changes suggested in my grading thereof) as
  well as any new analyses which seem desirable as you have made
  further progress. Only the most relevant analyses should be included
  by now. You _may_ put the rest in an Appendix (but you probably shouldn't). 
3. __Results and analysis__ (about 5 pages) Address 
  the specific question(s) of interest with methods of your choice (these can graphical, numerical, 
  or statistical models). 
  Be sure to justify the choices you make, and explain why your calculations lead to the 
  results that you discuss. Models without careful justification, figures presenting irrelevant material,
  or large tables of uninterpreted numbers will be treated harshly.
4. __Discussions/results__ (1 page) What are your conclusions?  Identify a few key
  findings, and discuss, with reference to the supporting evidence.  Can you
  come up with explanations for the patterns you have found?  Suggestions or
  recommendations for future work?  How could your analysis be improved?  


Total page length: __15 pages__ + appendix as necessary. Again, be sure to describe your graphics carefully. Plots with no description are useless.
As before, anything exceptionally useful will be
rewarded. Ugly plots, uninterpretable analysis, etc. will be
penalized.

### PC 3 rubric

```{r grade-vector-pc3, echo=FALSE}
a = c(8, 1, 7, 4, 15, 30, 10, 0)
tot = sum(a)
ab_print <- function(pos, modify){
  a <- a
  b <- a[pos]
  c <- b + modify
  a[pos] <- c
  a <<- a
  paste0(c,' / ', b)
}
```

__Words__ (`r ab_print(1, 0)`) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions and
transitions between sections and sub-sections.  The writing itself is
well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors, divided into
complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and sections, and easy to
follow from the presumed level of knowledge.

__Numbers__ (`r ab_print(2, 0)`) All numerical results or summaries are reported to
suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty attached when
applicable.

__Pictures__ (`r ab_print(3, 0)`) Figures and tables are easy to read, with informative
captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the relevant pieces of
text.

__Code__ (`r ab_print(4, 0)`) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy
for others to read and understand.  It is indented, commented, and uses
meaningful names.  It only includes computations which are actually needed to
answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy.  Code borrowed from the
notes, from books, or from resources found online is explicitly acknowledged
and sourced in the comments.  Functions or procedures not directly taken from
the notes have accompanying tests which check whether the code does what it is
supposed to. The text of the report is free of intrusive blocks of code.  If
you use R Markdown, all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits,
and only relevant results are shown. 

__Exploratory Data Analysis__ (`r ab_print(5, 0)`) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.

__Results and analysis__ (`r ab_print(6, 0)`) The statistical summaries
are clearly related to, or possibly derive from, the substantive questions of interest.  Any
assumptions are checked by means of appropriate diagnostic plots or
formal tests. Limitations from un-fixable problems are
clearly noted. The actual estimation
of parameters, predictions, or other calculations are technically correct.  All calculations
based on estimates are clearly explained, and also technically correct.  All
estimates or derived quantities are accompanied with appropriate measures of
uncertainty. 

__Conclusions__ (`r ab_print(7, 0)`) The substantive questions are answered as
precisely as the data and the model allow.  The chain of reasoning from
estimation results about models, or derived quantities, to substantive
conclusions is both clear and convincing.  Contingent answers ("if $X$, then
$Y$, but if $Z$, then $W$") are likewise described as warranted by the
and data.  If uncertainties in the data mean the answers to some
questions must be imprecise, this too is reflected in the conclusions.


__Extra credit__ (`r ab_print(8, 0)`) Up to twenty points may be awarded for reports which
are unusually well-written, where the code is unusually elegant, where the
analytical methods are unusually insightful, or where the analysis goes beyond
the required set of analytical questions.


__Grade__: `r sum(a)` out of `r tot` possible

## Presentations

These will be delivered during the final week of classes. Each group should prepare a 15 minute (maximum) presentation emphasizing the data, question, methods, and conclusions of their project. You should prepare slides (this can be done easily in Rmarkdown) which shows appropriate graphical displays and aids the delivery. In preparing the presentation you should be aiming it at a smart audience with statistical training to the level of multiple linear regression but not beyond. Hence, you should not just say “We did KNN” but also explain the basic idea of how it works, why it might be better than linear regression etc. Among other things, points will be allocated for clear articulations of the question of interest, the approach you used to solve it, the reason you chose that approach, and the conclusions you were able to draw.
