<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The premise of this project is simple. You are to pick a real data set for which you believe there are interesting questions to answer. Alternatively, you will try to create/find a dataset that you can use to answer some question your group cares about. You will then use appropriate statistical learning approaches, covered in this course or others, to answer the questions to the extent possible.</p>
<p>You will submit three written components and your group will deliver a 15 minute presentation during the last week of class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project checkpoint 0: due <strong>Thursday, January 30</strong></li>
<li>Project checkpoint 1: due <strong>Thursday, January 30</strong></li>
<li>Project checkpoint 2: due <strong>Thursday, March 12</strong></li>
<li>Project checkpoint 3: due <strong>Tuesday, May 5</strong></li>
<li>Project presentations: Tuesday/Thursday, April 28/30</li>

<div id="checkpoint-0" class="section level2">
<h2>Checkpoint 0</h2>
<p>Before the due date of checkpoint 1, you must let me know (via Slack) who is in your group. This way I can create a repo for you to collaborate and submit your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-checkpoint-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Project checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>This is a 1-page long synopsis of your intentions. It should contain the following information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>project title</li>
<li>team members</li>
<li>description of the data (include the number of observations, number of predictors, what the different predictors are, etc.)</li>
<li>precise description of the question(s) you are trying to answer</li>
<li>a few sentences describing why this question/dataset is interesting to you</li>
<li>reading list (papers you may need to read)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="project-checkpoint-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Project checkpoint 2</h2>
<p>This should build on the previous submission.</p>
<p>Your report must consist of the following sections.</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Project title and list of teammates</li>
<li>A few sentences describing why this project is interesting to you (approx 1 paragraph).</li>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> A description of how the data came about and what things you may be investigating. What is the data? What are you trying to do? How did you get the data? Why should anyone care about any of this? Etc., etc. (approx 0.5–1 page)<br />
This section will appear in your final report as well, possibly expanded to foreshadow the results you have by that point discovered, so spend some time to make it good, and your effort will not be wasted.</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory data analysis:</strong> Begin to examine your data. Make many graphics.
<ul>
<li>This is exploratory. Even basic conclusions are useful.</li>
<li>Go overboard. Make far more plots than you will keep</li>
<li>I strongly urge you to divide and conquer. Have different group members investigate different things. Recombine to discuss your results and iterate.</li>
<li>Do not leave this until the last minute. I guarantee you will receive poor scores. This will take sustained, consistent effort. Start NOW.</li>
</ul>
This section should occupy the remainder of your report.</li>
</ol>
<p>Total page length: about 10 pages. It will render in html, and graphics may be large, but this is the idea were it to be printed. Be sure to describe your graphics carefully both in the text and with nice labels. Plots with no description are not useful. Anything exceptionally interesting will be rewarded. Ugly plots, uninterpretable analysis, etc. will be penalized.</p>
<div id="pc-2-rubric" class="section level3">
<h3>PC 2 Rubric</h3>
<p><strong>Words</strong> (7 / 7) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors, divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers</strong> (1 / 1) All numerical results or summaries are reported to suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty attached when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Pictures</strong> (8 / 8) Figures and tables are easy to read, with informative captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the relevant pieces of text or referred to with convenient labels.</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong> (4 / 4) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy for others to read and understand. It is indented, commented, and uses meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. With regards to R Markdown, all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only relevant results are shown.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory data analysis</strong> (15 / 15) Variables are examined individually and bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and potential models is clearly explained.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit</strong> (0 / 0) Up to ten points may be awarded for reports which are unusually well-written, where the code is unusually elegant, where the analytical methods are unusually insightful, or where the analysis goes beyond the required set of analytical questions.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: 35 out of 35 possible</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="project-checkpoint-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Project checkpoint 3</h2>
<p>Each group should submit one report. It must consist of the following sections. (page numbers are relative as your report should render in html)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> (1 page) Write three to four paragraphs introducing the research problem and describing the specific research hypothesis. Cite any information sources in parentheses or foot- or end- notes.</li>
<li><strong>EDA</strong> (about 5 pages) This section should incorporate some material from the Midterm report (with any changes suggested in my grading thereof) as well as any new analyses which seem desirable as you have made further progress. Only the most relevant analyses should be included by now. You <em>may</em> put the rest in an Appendix (but you probably shouldn’t).</li>
<li><strong>Results and analysis</strong> (about 5 pages) Address the specific question(s) of interest with methods of your choice (these can graphical, numerical, or statistical models). Be sure to justify the choices you make, and explain why your calculations lead to the results that you discuss. Models without careful justification, figures presenting irrelevant material, or large tables of uninterpreted numbers will be treated harshly.</li>
<li><strong>Discussions/results</strong> (1 page) What are your conclusions? Identify a few key findings, and discuss, with reference to the supporting evidence. Can you come up with explanations for the patterns you have found? Suggestions or recommendations for future work? How could your analysis be improved?</li>
</ol>
<p>Total page length: <strong>15 pages</strong> + appendix as necessary. Again, be sure to describe your graphics carefully. Plots with no description are useless. As before, anything exceptionally useful will be rewarded. Ugly plots, uninterpretable analysis, etc. will be penalized.</p>

<h3>PC 3 rubric</h3>
<p><strong>Words</strong> (8 / 8) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors, divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers</strong> (1 / 1) All numerical results or summaries are reported to suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty attached when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Pictures</strong> (7 / 7) Figures and tables are easy to read, with informative captions, axis labels and legends, and are placed near the relevant pieces of text.</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong> (4 / 4) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy for others to read and understand. It is indented, commented, and uses meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. If you use R Markdown, all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only relevant results are shown.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> (15 / 15) Variables are examined individually and bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and potential models is clearly explained.</p>
<p><strong>Results and analysis</strong> (30 / 30) The statistical summaries are clearly related to, or possibly derive from, the substantive questions of interest. Any assumptions are checked by means of appropriate diagnostic plots or formal tests. Limitations from un-fixable problems are clearly noted. The actual estimation of parameters, predictions, or other calculations are technically correct. All calculations based on estimates are clearly explained, and also technically correct. All estimates or derived quantities are accompanied with appropriate measures of uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> (10 / 10) The substantive questions are answered as precisely as the data and the model allow. The chain of reasoning from estimation results about models, or derived quantities, to substantive conclusions is both clear and convincing. Contingent answers (“if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, but if <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>”) are likewise described as warranted by the and data. If uncertainties in the data mean the answers to some questions must be imprecise, this too is reflected in the conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit</strong> (0 / 0) Up to twenty points may be awarded for reports which are unusually well-written, where the code is unusually elegant, where the analytical methods are unusually insightful, or where the analysis goes beyond the required set of analytical questions.</p>
<p><strong>Grade</strong>: 75 out of 75 possible</p>

<div id="presentations" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>These will be delivered during the final week of classes. Each group should prepare a 15 minute (maximum) presentation emphasizing the data, question, methods, and conclusions of their project. You should prepare slides (this can be done easily in Rmarkdown) which shows appropriate graphical displays and aids the delivery. In preparing the presentation you should be aiming it at a smart audience with statistical training to the level of multiple linear regression but not beyond. Hence, you should not just say “We did KNN” but also explain the basic idea of how it works, why it might be better than linear regression etc. Among other things, points will be allocated for clear articulations of the question of interest, the approach you used to solve it, the reason you chose that approach, and the conclusions you were able to draw.</p>
